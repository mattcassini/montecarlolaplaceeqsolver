Solving PDEs using Monte-Carlo simulation for Math 450

This is the final project for Math 450 Honors at NJIT under Prof Lou Kondic.
This project is authored by Matt Cassini, Moises Ramos, and Marissah McNeil.

Specifically, we plan to solve Laplace's Equation using the Tour Du Wino Method, a type of Monte-Carlo simulation, that utilizes a random walk simulation to solve the PDE given boundary conditions.
